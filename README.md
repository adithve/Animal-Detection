The project aims to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts in rural areas by detecting wild animals in real-time using CCTV cameras and a YOLOv8-based object detection model.The system is designed to automatically identify dangerous wildlife (like elephants, leopards, bears, etc.) from live video feeds and alert concerned authorities via email and SMS.Using a curated dataset of annotated images, the YOLOv8 model was trained to detect 8 wild animal species commonly found in Kerala. Key components include model training with CNN integration, dataset preprocessing, bounding box annotation, real-time CCTV feed analysis, and a notification system using Twilio and Gmail API. The model achieved an average mAP of 0.77, showing reliable performance, even under night-vision conditions.The project demonstrates practical applications in wildlife conservation, traffic safety, and farm protection. Future scope includes integrating thermal imaging, real-time animal tracking, predictive analytics, and community-supported mobile apps for broader ecological impact. More details are attached.
